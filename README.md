# AVL-Tree-Subtree-Check

This program reads a file containing a list of integers and builds an AVL tree from them. It then checks if the tree is a valid AVL tree and outputs the minimum, maximum and average keys of the tree. If two filenames are passed as arguments, the program reads two files containing lists of integers and builds two AVL trees from them. It then checks whether the second tree is a subtree of the first tree or not.

Since the main functionality of the program is to check if a tree is a valid AVL tree and whether one tree is a subtree of another, I have named this program "AVL-Tree Subtree Check".
